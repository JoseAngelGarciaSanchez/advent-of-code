# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

### Welcome to the Repository for Advent of Code Challenge Solutions
This repository is dedicated to housing the coding solutions for various challenges from the Advent of Code (AoC). The primary goal of this initiative is to foster a collaborative and educational environment within our team. Each member is encouraged to participate in the Advent of Code challenge, and subsequently share their unique solutions with the rest of the team (from 13h30 to 13h45 in december). This approach not only enhances our problem-solving skills but also provides an opportunity for knowledge exchange and collective learning.

By reviewing each other's approaches and solutions, we aim to broaden our understanding of different coding techniques and strategies.

We invite all team members to contribute their solutions, ideas, and insights as we navigate through the exciting challenges that AoC has to offer. Let's code, share, and learn together!

### Data storage
For efficient organization and accessibility, it is strongly advised to store the input data, which is uniquely generated for each individual within their Advent of Code (AoC) space, in a dedicated `data` folder. This folder should be conveniently located adjacent to the `src` folder in your project structure. To maintain consistency and ease of identification, the files should be named following a standardized format, such as 'day1.txt', 'day2.txt', and so on. This approach ensures a clear and structured file management system, facilitating smoother workflow and data retrieval.
